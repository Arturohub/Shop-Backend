I decided to start the path of becoming a full stack developer on Monday 8th January 2024.

Web designing and developing was something I always wanted to learn, so I decided to go for it full time.

My first project was a simple HTML + CSS webpage (no React, no Vue, nothing) for a future Furniture Restoration Shop for my girlfriend. This project is a revamped version of that first project.

This revamped version has the following features:

  Frontend:
    React
    JWT authentication with cookie
    A blog for commenting about news regarding the shop or even personal stuff
    A shop for displaying new furniture


  Backend: 
    Node + Express for setting up RESTful API (with routes, controllers, middleware)
    A NoSQL database, MongoDB, for fetching all data regarding the page (blogs, users, products...)
    Cloudinary as a picture hosting service

I am quite happy with this project. Helped me to set some pillars and getting confidence about the skills learnt during this journey. Now, the path continues. Let's go for some good old PHP and keep learning more SQL :D (Java will go next)
